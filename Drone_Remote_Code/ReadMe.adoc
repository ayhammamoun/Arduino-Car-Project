   Notes:

    The remote board will have two joystick and four buttons, 1 HC-04, 1 LCD DISPLAY SHIELD
    an arduino uno
    
    The left joystick will have two axis: x and y.
    The X axis will have a range from 0 to 1023
    The Y axis will have a range from 0 to 1023
    The normal state of X is 494
    The normal state of Y is 496
    
    X axis:
    The X axis will control the movement of the drone to the left with the range of tilt depending on the joystick(i.e from 494 to 1023)
    The Negative X axis will control the movement of the drone to the right  with the range of tilt depending on the joystick(i.e from 494 to 0)
    
    Y axis:
    The Y axis will control the movmennt of the drone to the front with the range of tilt depending on the joystick (i.e from 496 to 1023)
    The Negateve Y axis will control the movement of the drone to the back with the range of tilt depending on the Joystick (i.e from 496 to 0)
    
    SW Button:
    STABLE MODE:
    the button of the left joystick is used to stabilize the drone and make so if it was moved by another external object it will stay stable at the appropiate hight
    
    The right joystick will have two axis: x and y
    The X axis will have a range from 0 to 1023
    The Y axis will have a range from 0 to 1023
    The normal state of X is 502
    The normal state of Y is 510
    
    X axis:
    The Y axis will control the thrust of the engines on the drone if the joystick is on normal state the engine will be off or running on enough power to hold the drone depending 
    on the mode choosen
    The X axis will control the rotation of the drone, the more the stick is on left it will rotate anticlockwise and vise versa
    
    SW button:
    ABORT:
    Used for auto landing, normally in case of emergency
    
    The negative is the value which is below the normal state of an axis on the joystick
    
    The button will be laid on the remote as a square
    Button 1 will be on the top left
    And button 2 will be on the top right
    And button 3 will be on the buttom left
    And button 4 will be on the buttom right
    
    Button 1:
    the output of the button will be connected on the arduino PWM11
    Use:
    Enable safe mode
    Safe mode is a mode that ensourse that the plan will not fall below 30 cm
    Better to be used when doing stunts for saftey measures. 
    WARNING THIS DOES NOT WORKING WITH 360 MODE ENABLED
    
    Button 2:
    the output of the button will be connected on the arduino PWM10
    Use:
    Enable disable safety measures
    To turn off or on the all safety measure. just like manuall flight.
    This clearly puts all the responsiblity on the pilot of the drone. AND THE PROGRAM HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN CASE OF A CRASH
    
    Button 3:
    the output of the button will be connected on the arduino PWM9
    Use:
    Enable/Disable Lights:
    Enable the lights on the drone representing the drone mode.
    
    Button 4:
    the output of the button will be connected on teh arduino DIG8
    Use:
  Enable Revirse thrust:
   This enables the engines to reverse thrust, and bring the drone lower faster.
   This should not be used only in stunts
   NOTE: THIS ONLY ENABLE OR DISABLES THE NEGATIVE PART OF THE RIGHT Y AXIS JOYSTICK
